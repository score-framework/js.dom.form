Very low-level form handling library.

Quickstart
==========

This library ist foremost for providing a uniform API across all form fields:

.. code-block:: javascript

    var fruit = score.dom.field.select([
        [1, 'oranges'],
        [2, 'apples'],
        [3, 'pomegrenades'],
        [4, 'greengages'],
        [5, 'grapes'],
        [6, 'passion fruit'],
        [7, 'lemons'],
        [8, 'plums'],
        [9, 'mangoes in syrup'],
        [10, 'cherries (red and black)'],
        [11, 'bananas']
    ]);
    fruit.on('input', function() {
        // this function will be called whenever the
        // user changes the select value.
    });
    fruit.on('change', function() {
        // this function will be called whenever the
        // user changes the select value *or* the value
        // is set programmatically.
    });

    score.dom('#some-node').append(fruit.node);

    fruit.setValue(8);  // will trigger 'change' and set
                         // the selected value 8 (plums)

    fruit.setValue(12); // will throw an Error since id
                         // 12 does not exist.

You can combine multiple fields to create a form object, which can be used to
set multiple values at once:

.. code-block:: javascript

    // note that the only requirement for the variable `attacker` in the
    // following code block is that it must be a form.field object, it does not
    // matter whether this is a select, an input, a textarea or something else:
    var form = score.dom.form({
        'fruit': fruit,
        'attacker': attacker
    });

    form.setValue({
        'fruit': 11,
        'attacker': 'Harrison'
    });

    fruit.getValue();    // returns 11 (banana)
    attacker.getValue(); // returns 'Harrison'

Details
=======

Using existing nodes
--------------------

All existing field objects optionally accept a DOM Node as first parameter. The
parameter is expected to be of the correct type for the used class:

.. code-block:: javascript

    var select = new score.domf.form.field.select('select#fruits');
    select.getValue();  // returns whatever was currently selected in the DOM

Events
------

Field objects have two different events:

* **change**: Triggered, whenever the value of this field changes.
* **input**: Triggered only when the value is changed through user-input.


Extending
---------

The parent class of all form fields (score.dom.form.field) has two abstract
methods, that need to be overriden by implementing child classes:

.. code-block:: javascript

    var Input = new score.oop.Class({
        __name__: 'InputField',
        __parent__: score.dom.form.field,

        __init__: function() {
            // simplified implentation for demonstration
            self.node = score.dom.create('input');
        },

        _getValue: function(self) {
            return self.node.DOMNode.value;
        },

        _setValue: function(self, value) {
            self.node.DOMNode.value = value;
        }

    });

Customizing
-----------

This module creates the minimum number of DOM nodes necessary for implementing
the required field. You can create sub-classes, if you want a different DOM
layout. The following example wraps the <input> element inside a <div> and adds
a <label>:

.. code-block:: javascript

    var LabeledInput = new score.oop.Class({
        __name__: 'LabeledInputField',
        __parent__: score.dom.form.field.input,

        __init__: function(labelText) {
            self.__super__();
            self.node = score.dom.create('div');
            self.label = score.dom.create('label');
            self.label.text(labelText);
            self.node.append(self.label);
            self.node.append(self.input);
        }

    });


API
===

class ``score.dom.form(fields)``
    Wraps multiple fields to provide a single setter/getter for all field
    values at once. The provided ``fields`` parameter must be an object mapping
    field names to ``score.dom.form.field`` objects.

    ``getValue()``
        Get the values of each field of this form. The return value is an
        object mapping each field name to the value of the corresponding field
        (as defined by ``score.dom.form.field.getValue()``)

    ``setValue(value)``
        Sets the values of all managed fields. Note that all field names must
        be present in the provided *value*.


class ``score.dom.form.field()``
    An abstract Field class providing unifying the value setting/retrieval
    API.

    ``getValue()``
        Get the value of this field.

    ``setValue(value)``
        Sets the values of this field and returns this field object.


class ``score.dom.form.field.input(node)``
    An ``<input>`` field. The optional *node* parameter can be either of the
    following:

    * ``undefined`` or ``null``: A new node object will be created by the
      constructor.
    * a `score.dom` object
    * anything that can be used to create a `score.dom` object with (a
      selector string, a ``DOMNode``, an ``HTMLCollection``, ...)


class ``score.dom.form.field.password(node)``
    A ``<password>`` field. The *node* parameter is the same as that for the
    <input> field.


class ``score.dom.form.field.textarea(node)``
    A ``<textarea>`` field. The *node* parameter is the same as that for the
    <input> field.


class ``score.dom.form.field.select(nodeOrOptions)``
    A ``<select>`` field. The constructor parameter *nodeOrOptions* must either
    be a node (anything accepted by the constructor of the InputField is fine),
    or a list of key-value tuples. Example:

    .. code-block:: javascript

        new score.dom.form.field.select([
            [1, 'foo'],
            [2, 'bar'],
        ])

    Why doesn't the constructor accept objects? Because `objects do not
    preserve property order in javascript
    <http://stackoverflow.com/a/5525820/44562>`_.
